# Elias Fleckenstein

I'm Elias Fleckenstein, a 16 year old open source developer and hacker from germany. I am well known in the [Minetest](http://minetest.net/) community to maintaining [MineClone2](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/mineclone2), which is a FOSS clone of Minecraft and the most downloaded Minetest subgame. I also created [Dragonfireclient](https://github.com/dragonfireclient/dragonfireclient), a popular cheat client used by the Minetest anarchy community. In addition to that, I made a big collection of server-side mods for Minetest, and client-side mods for Dragonfireclient, and I have owned and/or moderated / written custom software for many servers. Last but not least, I have contributed to the Minetest Engine itself.

I also have projects unrelated to Minetest, most notably the [Dragonblocks](https://github.com/dragonblocks) universe - which is a collection of 2D and 3D voxelgames.

I created the Elidragon programming group, and I mostly administrate and pay for our server.

I use Plan 9 (9front) and GNU/Linux (kubuntu), and I have contributed patches to both Plan 9 and the Linux kernel.

My projects are sorted and explained on [my website](https://fleckenstein.elidragon.com/). Despite making use of GitHub's organizations feature, my GitHub repository page is somewhat chaotic due to the big number of repositories. Therefore, if you want to find out about my work, it is recommended check out my website.
